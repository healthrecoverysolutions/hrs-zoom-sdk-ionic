# Deleted files 
Font and icon files deleted as part of the migration from Ionic 4 to Ionic 5 (JIR-2249).
The following files were no longer being used in any of the apps, and the desire moving forward was to not use these fonts or icons. 
Thus the following files were deleted:

// Ionicons 
ionicons.scss
ionicons.eot
ionicons.ttf
ionicons.svg
ionicons.woff
ionicons.woff2

// Roboto Font
roboto.scss
roboto-light.ttf
roboto-light.woff
roboto-light.woff2

// Noto Sans Font
